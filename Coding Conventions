Coding Conventions:
1) All Variables and Function names (unless optional functions provided by delegates) have to be camel case. e.g. myVariable
                 myFunction()
2) All Classes have to be capitalized both words e.g. MyClass
3) Use tab for indents, everything after the class declaration should be indented
4) Use Aliman brace placement for functions and classes
e.g. 
myFunc()
{
    // Do something
}
